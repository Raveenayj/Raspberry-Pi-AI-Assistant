# Raspberry Pi Google AI Assistant Using Push-to-talk Feature
IOT project to build a Raspberry Pi Google AI Assistant

# Abstract
The main aim of this project is to build a Raspberry Pi voice-controlled AI Assistant. Itâ€™s the age of AI, and we all are swarmed away with the number of mesmerizing open-source AI projects getting in the market every day. They are one of the driving factors for business growth. 
Google provides the API for using its voice service, which is open source. Using Google voice service, we can play music, get information about weather, book tickets and many more. We just need to ask. In this project, we build and configure our own Raspberry Pi-powered Google Assistant. 

# Pre-requisites
Raspberry Pi 3 <br/>
Micro SD Card <br/>
USB Microphone <br/>
Speaker <br/>
WiFi <br/>

# Result
The Google AI Assistant that we build using Raspberry Pi functions as expected. It can successfully respond to all queries. It can understand the context of our query and react in an informed or smart way. This is important as it gives voice control a lot more power and moves it on from only reacting to specific phrases or commands.

# Demo
We have sent the video recording of project demonstration via email. The recording files are big in size, therefore, cannot be uploaded in github. <br />
